# Middle-Out Thinking
- **Use** The Black Box method **to learn** the inputs **and** outputs of a concept without knowing its internal working. An action verb **makes us do** something, **and** we see what it does, but not how it does it. **Then, build** a feedback loop with that information you've **learned**. ^w31xw

#### Concepts
- An abstract idea **arranged** by a set of principles and actions **performed**.
	For every instance brought up, **think** about the action verb(s) **representing** the concept(s).
