1. Define (by asking why, what, where, how, who) a function (action verbs) controlling the form (nouns), or the form controlled by a function. ^6br3d

3. Use an antonym for any function (action verbs) to replace any negative functions (action verbs) and identify new forms (nouns) within. ^cqe6x

Functions either complement or mix with each other for any outcome;  
Forms are factors, and follow Functions are actions you can control.
- **Layer 1** - Identify, Define, and Link Functions
1. Define (by asking why, what, where, how, who) a function controlling the form, or the form controlled by a function.
2. Recursively find forms within the definition and define those forms and their functions to find those forms to define.
- **Layer 2** - Replacing Functions in any Problem
3. Use an antonym for any function to replace any negative functions and identify new forms within.
4. Recursively define synonyms in the functions of the form with  (hyponyms and hypernyms) and define forms within to replace.
