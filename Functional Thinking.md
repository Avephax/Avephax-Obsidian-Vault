### A.K.A. First Principles Thinking
1. **Spot the Function by an Action Verb:** Find an essential function or action using action verbs that are crucial to the topic or skill you want to understand. ^6br3d

2. **Name the Core Functions or Actions:** From the spotted action verb, explicitly name the noun(s) or action that represents the central purpose of the action verb. ^a5hxg

3. **Using Antonyms for Negative Functions (Optional):** If you encounter a negative function (action verb) in a problem, use an antonym to change to a positive action. ^cqe6x

4. **Explore Other Forms by Synonyms and Nouns:** After naming the core function, use synonyms and alternate forms of the function. ^n-36f

- **Find** a statementâ€™s function (action verb) and **answer** **yes or no** if we can break it down.
	If **answering** yes, **ask** **What?, Why?, How?, Where?, When?, Who?, Which?, Whose?** to the function and **use** answer as new statement.
	If/when **answering** "no", **accept** the statement a basic function to apply.
