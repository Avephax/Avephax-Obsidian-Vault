Functions are used for searching, Forms are the Functions (Inputs) extracted and Definitions (Outputs) are for going into or returning to identifying Forms and Functions.

- **Layer 1** - Identify, Define, and Link Functions
1. Define a form (noun) (by going into or return to why, what, where, how, who) next to a function (action verb) and extract it. ^6br3d
	- [[Functional Thinking#^a5hxg]]
2. Go into or return to the form (noun) and recursively search up related forms (nouns) using related functions [(action verbs)](http://www.sinonimkata.com/). ^a5hxg

- **Layer 2** - Replacing Functions in any Problem
3. Extract an antonym to replace any negative function (action verbs) and use to recursively search and extract new forms (nouns) to define. ^cqe6x

    - [[Associative Learning Loop#^okqvo]]
4. Combine and extrapolate new and/or previous defined forms (nouns) by functions (action verbs) and repeat. ^rkcf4
