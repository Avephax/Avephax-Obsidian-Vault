4. **Use Alternate Verbs or Nouns for the Function:** **Answer** **yes or no** if we can break the function down **then use synonyms on verbs and nouns**.
	If **answering** yes, **ask** **How (Action Verb) and Why (Action Verb)** or **What (Noun), Where (Noun), Which (Noun), Who (Noun), When (Noun) and Whose (Noun)**.
	If/when **answering** "no", **accept** the statement a basic function to apply.
