Functions interconnect, both in explicit and implicit forms. They can either complement or mix with others for any outcome.
- **Layer 1** - Identify, Define, and Link Functions
1. Define (and go into or return to why, what, where, how, who) a form (noun) extracted from a function (action verb) or a function by the form extracted. ^6br3d

2. Go into or return to defining forms (nouns) and extract related forms next of their defined functions [(action verbs)](http://www.sinonimkata.com/). ^a5hxg

- **Layer 2** - Replacing Functions in any Problem
3. Define an antonym/opposite function (action verbs) from any negative function and define newly forms (nouns) to extract. ^cqe6x

4. Relate, combine and extrapolate functions (action verbs) by new and previous defined forms (nouns) and repeat. ^rkcf4
