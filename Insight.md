## Notes
- Insights are the secret maneuvers from unique steps out of concepts that have been previously observed and/or discovered. They reduce the risk of tripping over future problems that use said concept in a certain way while also giving you a much deeper understanding of a concept.
- Insights makes [[Concept.canvas|concepts]] stronger by their abundance. The more of them there are, the easier it is to reason behind using a concept. They can be generated out of any application, solution, or problems from multifaceted subjects, methods, (un)conscious thoughts, etc.
- In the context of Obsidian Canvas, Put insights inside of its related Concept MOC as a card until you come across enough details to break it down into smaller cards.
