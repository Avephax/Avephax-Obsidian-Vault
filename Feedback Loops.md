- Repeating is the Mother of Learning; the core of what makes up Implicit Learning.
    Every Feedback Loop is a chain of actions you can choose to do, waiting to support itself every time we do it. ^efyp1

- You can almost always hold the situation you are in. If you can't, then you change how you view the situation. Attitudes only point what you will feel in any situation. ^taoaj

- Cause and effect are largely disconnected, meaning the effect from an action can happen, but in the far future. ^t0-4d
