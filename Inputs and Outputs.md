## Love the Process & Do It
- **Inputs function towards outputs** and **outputs function from inputs**, they are both **bridged** through the **verbs** we **act**.
    All you have to do is **control inputs (action verbs)** **to control** the **output (your life).**
    Every **action verb** **applies** an **input**, which **brings** a **reaction**.
    You **become** what you **choose to act** on.
    You **learn to enjoy** **the process** of learning through your **actions**.
    **Don’t expect** a **new output** from **the same input** **you apply**.

- **Ask** questions **to determine the inputs** needed for a desired output. Reverse-engineer outcomes **to understand** their inputs **and love the process**. **Don’t expect** a new output from the same input **you apply**. ^qmqr3

- **Time** = Attention-based **currency** that **can change inputs**. **Look into why you commit** any input based on the positive returns, **Identify and replace** those inputs for greater returns. ^xsh0i

	- [[Inputs and Outputs#^rk53w|How Goals Work!]]
- Consistent Action: Volume of Input × Action Verb(s) = Output - Consistent action **reiterates** volume of input, and **Action verbs** reinforce the input. **Use and Switch** the right inputs **consistently** for the desired output(s); Over time, the compounding effect will **occur** in your favor. ^kgw9n

- Defined goals = [Volume of Input × Action Verb(s)] ^ Time - **List off** long-term vision and **use action verb(s) consistently** for desired outcomes. ^rk53w

#### Protean Identity
 - Character Traits: **Act** positive character traits like you **already possess** them. You can **change, replace and develop** them over time. ^j3k1s

- Skills: **Link and stack** skills together, **stack** them on top of each other **to bring** more value. Consistent use of action verbs **is key to master** any skill. ^el6og

- Beliefs: **Question and challenge** your existing beliefs **to align them** with First Principles Thinking. Your beliefs **shape** your reality and **dictate** your actions. ^4kbly

#### Positively Feed the Feedback Loop
- What someone **offers** you any constructive criticism, **take** their feedback **to utilize** new input(s). ^9g-9m
	- [[Inputs and Outputs#^-c96l|Output becomes the Input]]
- **Bring in** criticism as an opportunity **to upgrade and replace** your process, **turn** the output into a new input. Each new input **reinforces** the feedback loop. ^-c96l
