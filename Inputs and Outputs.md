# Love the Process & Do It Afraid
- Input: Dynamic verbs that **bring** equal or opposite reactions. Outputs (Reactions) **depend** on the volume of input(s) **you apply**; **Reinforce** inputs after each other **to better memorize and acquire** habits. Output consists of: volume of inputs × pushing effort (pushing) = how much the output **reacts to** the process.

- **Ask** questions to **determine the inputs** needed for a desired output. Reverse-engineer outcomes **to understand** their inputs **and love the process**. **Don’t expect** a new output from the same input **you apply**. ^qmqr3

- Time = Attention-based currency that **can change inputs**. **Look into why you commit** any input based on the positive returns, **Identify and replace** those inputs for greater returns. ^xsh0i

## Dynamic Verbs
- Dynamic (action) verbs are inputs **we can take**, or things that **happen**; **they end** with **to, -s, -es, -ing, or -ed**.
- Action Verbs that end with **-s, -es or irregularly** **show** the inputs. **Find** and accept the presence of **to, -s, -es** endings to action verbs as fact.
- Action Verbs in **-ing and -ed** forms **show** progression (to continue) and the past, **respectively**. **Always ask** questions with these verbs.
- **Remove** **"-ing or -ed"** in action verbs **and write** the basic form of the action verb with **to, -s, and/or -es**.
- **Ask** question sentences that start with "**do**," "**does**," or "**did**."
- **Read and/or Put** "**do not**," "**did not**," or "**does not**" before the action verb for negative sentences.
- **Ask "what" or "why"** at action verbs **to further grasp** of a concept.
- **Add -ing or -ed** to **transform** the verb from its base form.
- **Observe and determine** actions verbs in contractions.
- Use **-ize, -ify, -en, or -ate** to turn nouns into action verbs.
- Consistent Action = (Volume of Input × Pushing) - Consistent action **reiterates** volume of input, and **pushing** effort **multiplies** it. **Push** the right inputs **consistently** for the desired outputs; Over time, the compounding effect **occurs** in your favor. ^kgw9n

- Defined goals = (Volume of Input × Pushing) ^ Time - **Pursue** long-term vision and **practice consistently** for desired outcomes. ^rk53w

#### Protean Identity
 - Character Traits: **Act** positive character traits like you **already possess** them. You can **change, replace and develop** them over time. ^j3k1s
	- From: [[Inputs and Outputs#^el6og]]
- Skills: **Link and stack** skills together, **stack** them on top of each other **to bring** more value. Consistent practice **is key to master** any skill. ^el6og

- Beliefs: **Question and challenge** your existing beliefs to **align them** with First Principles Thinking. Your beliefs **shape** your reality and **dictate** your actions. ^4kbly

#### Positively Feed the Feedback Loop
- Anytime someone **offers** you any constructive criticism, their feedback **become** your new inputs. ^9g-9m
	- [[Inputs and Outputs#^-c96l|Output becomes the Input]]
- **View** criticism as an opportunity **to upgrade and replace** your process, **turn** the output into a new input. Each new input **reinforces** the feedback loop. ^-c96l
