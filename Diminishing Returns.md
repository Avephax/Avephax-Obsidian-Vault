- [[Associative Learning]]
- [[First Principles Thinking]]

- The return of value an activity starts decreasing the more you do it.
- The goal is to always operate on the steep curve of ***progress***.
- This way you'll be pulling in high returns in the least amount of time.
- Once your returns start to diminish, refocus onto something else.

## Shed Maximization
- Choose your activities wisely
- Sacrifice some things to an extent to work on the aspirations you really want to achieve.

## Difficulty = High Value
- What am I missing out on by doing this activity instead?
- Avoid comfort in anything you're learning.

## Optimize your Optimization
- Don't strive to perfect your activity.
- If time allows it, add in some thoroughness on a finished product for extra flare.

## Optimizing your learning
***Achieve 80% of the insight(s)*** you can build off of ***first*** *(making progress)*, and add other insights when justified **(being thorough)**.
